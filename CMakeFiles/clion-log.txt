CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindGint.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Gint", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Gint" (requested
  version 2.1) with any of the following names:

    GintConfig.cmake
    gint-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Gint" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Gint_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Gint"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
